# Anna Costalonga's Portfolio

> Show, don't tell.

So, my new portfolio shows my proficiency with Rails, as it is a Rails 7 application built on Ruby 3.2, PostgreSQL,
JS, Stimulus.

It will have to:

[] show my bio.
[] show links to my Linkedin and Github and social media profiles.
[] articles, technical and non-technical, with a place for discussions.
[] show my projects. This could also be done through an article. As in "t"his was my project, yadda yadda. If you want to learn more about it, how I overcame etc, you can read the article here."
[] contact form for recruiters
[] A monthly Newsletter? Notable experiences of my life as a developer.
[] It is hosted on Google App Engine.

## UI
UI should be minimal, but responsive.
I would not introduce TailwindCSS.
